title: Welcome to the NUS String Theory Group!
---

String theory is the leading candidate for a unified theory of all the four fundamental forces of our universe which is supposed to explain physics at all scales. It has also been a rich source of inspiration for new mathematics, with recent applications even to quantum information theory and the study of strange metals.

We are a small but active group in the Physics Department, led by a faculty member, with several research fellows and graduate (PhD) students. Our work spans diverse areas of string/M-theory and quantum field theory, and their deep implications for contemporary mathematics. We also maintain close links with our colleagues in the Mathematics Department.
