#+TITLE: NUS String Theory Group Webpage Generator

This repository builds the webpage for the NUS String Theory Group webpage
hosted at [[https://phyweb.physics.nus.edu.sg/~strings/]].

*** For editors

Any changes to the data that needs to be reflected on the webpage should be made
in the [[./data][data]] directory. Simply follow the templated data structure, and the
website will be built without much human intervention.

To include images for group members, add them to the [[./assets/images/][images]] directory.

To edit or create new pages, add an Hugo-compatible Markdown file in the [[./content][content]]
directory and make sure to create the appropriate "buttons" and menu items in
[[./config.yaml][config.yaml]].

To customise the theme, refer to the documentation for the chosen theme. The
current chosen theme is [[https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod][PaperMod]].
